Adults swim at up to 20 km/hour in short bursts when pursuing prey, but they commute at a more energy-efficient 4-6 km/hour.</p><p> They dive to depths of more than 100 metres and remain underwater for at least three minutes, but most dives are to less than 30 metres and last about one minute. They hunt visually, so almost all dives occur during the day. Their pupils can expand and contract much more than other birds, allowing them to adapt rapidly to the gloomy light levels that prevail under water.</p>",

He had this to say about the Black Harrier: “Apparently nearing extinction. It is now only seen at all regularly in the dry country between Cape Town and Saldanha Bay.” Nearly 70 years later the situation was a bit more hopeful with an estimated 500 to 1 000 breeding pairs in total but the species is still classified as Near-threatened in South Africa. In the southern and south-western Western Cape, it is mostly found in strandveld and mountain fynbos and also in the ever-decreasing remnants of renosterveld. In the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu Natal and Free State, where it is sparsely distributed, it is mainly confined to the high-lying grasslands. It is also found in the southern North West Province and central Mpumalanga with a resident population in north-western Namibia.",

This pattern is however repeated in several animal groups, and suggests that in the past there was a belt of arid country linking these two regions. Like many other savanna weavers, the Chestnut Weaver is highly colonial, with up to 100 nests in a single tree. Nest sites are large trees in open grassland. The nest is built by the male, and typically has a short entrance tunnel pointing downwards; when the female has accepted a nest and mated with the owner, she will add a lining of grass seedheads. The males are generally polygynous, but their involvement in the breeding cycle is quite brief since they leave the colony while the females are incubating. The females are left to raise the young unaided. Red-headed Finches may displace female Chestnut Weavers from occupied nests. In some parts of Namibia, Chestnut Weavers are apparently resident, but most populations seem to be migratory. There is a recent record of this species from the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park, South Africa. Non-breeding birds flock and roost with other weavers, and they seem to have a particular association with the Red-billed Quelea.",

However, during the summer months the migrant is normally in non-breeding plumage, whereas all but the immatures of the Collared are in breeding plumage. These immatures often form non-breeding flocks while the adults are breeding, so it is essential to determine the identification characteristics if you want to separate these species.",

Some genetically intact, relic populations of the southern subspecies remain in certain– the ostriches at Kleinzee are reputed to be uncontaminated by ‘feather’ ostrich genes, and the ostriches of the Namib Desert, with their relatively long legs and small bodies, are thought to be genetically identical to the ostriches that roamed the plains of southern Africa a few centuries ago. </p><p> The historical range of Common Ostriches in southern Africa is not clear because of translocation of domestic birds. Place names andrelic populations suggest that the birds probably occurred throughout the semi-aridregions of Namibia, the Succulent and Nama Karoo, Botswana and south-western. Today, truly ‘wild’ ostriches occupy only a fraction of their historical range in southern Africa.</p><p>Ostriches favour semi-arid and arid grasslands and shrub lands, sparsely vegetated desert plains and open savanna woodlands, being most abundant on short-grass and in arid savannas. In the wild, ostriches are usually in pairs, small groups of 5-6 birds, or even larger groups of 30-40 birds, but they sometimes aggregate in very large numbers at water.

In the interests of finding out the food value of this plant, four researchers spent over an hour in a favoured ostrich    foraging area collecting these plants. In that time, we managed to gather less than 100 g between us, a tenth of what a single ostrich has in its gut.</p><p> A pervasive   myth about ostriches is that they eat anything. Not so. Their diet is almost entirely plant material, but does include small pieces of bone, teeth and shell fragments, probably eaten for the calcium content. The species’ breeding system is complex. </p> <p>Males are territorial and polygamous, mating with up to four females, one of whom is a ‘major’ female, and the others are ‘minors’. The major female is the first to lay in the nest (a shallow basin dug in a sandy patch), and subsequently incubates and guards the eggs. Minor females lay in the same nest – their eggs are on the edge of the nest and mostly not incubated. The eggs are large, very hard shelled and much sought-after by jackals and hyenas. The empty shells, used in the past for storage vessels, were an important part of the economy of hunter-gatherer peoples in southern Africa. Newly hatched young resemble hedgehogs, with spiky, black–tipped buff down on their backs and less spiky down below. </p>",

Several structural characteristics of this order facilitate their extraordinary talents: very long primaries, short humerus bones, and very weak feet, the latter reflected in swifts’ scientific name, literally translated to ‘without feet’.",

This is an interesting bird because our visitors reach us down both the west and east coasts of Africa. The west coast migrants are mainly birds from the Baltic but with quite a few Norwegian and north Russian birds, together with a very small proportion of British/Irish- and Dutch-bred birds, most of which winter further north in Africa. In Europe a migratory divide has evolved, and those birds breeding inland in eastern Germany, Poland and Lithuania south to the eastern Mediterranean and east into southern Russia and Belarus, migrate down the eastern side of Africa.",

As a result they tend to have higher wing loadings than most other petrels, and are less efficient dynamic soarers. Their common name stems from their tendency to fly low and fast over the water; literally ’shearing the water’. By trading off their flying ability for diving ability, they tend to be confined to regions of the world’s oceans that are productive in terms of food, and experience consistently high winds. The Calonectris shearwaters are exceptions to this pattern, as they have long, broad wings adapted for gliding in relatively unproductive, calm tropical waters. In terms of flight action, they are intermediate between Procellaria petrels and the Puffinus shearwaters. Their large wings compromise their diving ability, and Cory’s Shearwaters seldom dive to more than 5 metres. In fact, the maximum dive depth of most birds studied was less than 1 metre. They obtain much of their prey by surface-seizing or by shallow plunge-diving, splashing into the water from the air at a very shallow angle. They are agile in the air, often grabbing flying fish and Sauries in the air as they attempt to elude predatory fish or dolphins. Sometimes they fly in front of ships to pursue flying fish.",

Regional dialects are evident in the song, and are clearly important to the singers: when recordings of birds from KwaZulu-Natal were played to Eastern Cape birds, they paid no attention, but responded vigorously when their own individual songs were played back to them. Both sexes sing throughout the year, with the performance of a duet surely requiring some practice, and presumably playing a major part in the establishment and maintenance of their long-lasting pair bonds. Studies of captive birds with a human ‘tutor’ showed that young birds quickly learn to synchronise their whistles with those produced by their human partner, and it appears that the song is normally learnt within the first two years, and not modified thereafter.",

Its relative abundance in the non-breeding areas varies from year to year. It may be fairly common locally in some years, but absent in others.

Its large wings allow it to glide well, but make it quite buoyant, limiting its diving ability; most dives are only 3-5 metres deep. Birds from Lord Howe Island and northern New Zealand migrate into the North Pacific as far as Alaska, whereas those from St Paul Island and islands off south-west Australia disperse into the Indian Ocean. In southern Africa, they are most common off the east coast, especially off southern Mozambique and northern KwaZulu-Natal, where they are often the most abundant birds attending fishing vessels. Small numbers reach the Cape and straggle up the west coast as far as the Namibian border. They occur year-round, being more abundant off the east coast in winter and off the Cape in summer. Single birds have come ashore at night on Dyer Island, just west of Cape Agulhas, in September-October. This coincides with the start of the breeding season, and presumably they were prospecting for potential nesting sites, but failed to attract mates. Small numbers are killed on fishing gear (mainly longlines) and some colonies are impacted by introduced predators, but with a total population of close to a million birds it is not listed as threatened.",

Despite their large size, they are agile ashore, often commuting several kilometres inland to breed, and they can run surprisingly fast when necessary (such as when being pursued by a hungry chick!) They tend to breed in small colonies, often choosing different sites each year, but within the same general area.</p><p>At sea, Gentoo Penguins are largely sedentary, foraging in shelf waters close to their breeding colonies. As a result there are few records of vagrants wandering north of the Subtropical Convergence. Only one Gentoo Penguin has reached southern Africa. It was found on a beach north of Cape Town in June 1992. Gentoo Penguin numbers have increased in some areas notably in the Antarctic Peninsula where they appear to be benefiting from global warming.

The row of black spots on the wing coverts is well defined in this species. However, the best aid for identifying this bird is the single-note call which it adds to its song every now and again. This single note is a rather nasal ‘squeeeer’. It is loud and conspicuous and often draws attention to the bird, whose call is otherwise simply a series of whistled notes.",

Because of its strangely ‘undifferentiated’ appearance it can be a bit slippery in the field, and quite easily confused with Rock Kestrel Falco rupicolus, and even Lanner Falcon F. biarmicus, at a distance and under certain conditions, despite the fact that these other species have numerous field characters that should make them easily distinguishable. A useful guide for Greater Kestrel is the general lack of distinguishing features, except perhaps a pale overall appearance (particularly from below), noticeably large, rounded head, somewhat broad, rounded wings for a falcon, and quite slow, buoyant flight, which is almost gull-like at times.

However, the Greater Sheathbill gained our attention when one arrived in the Cape in 1986, after hopping a ride on a ship travelling from its usual haunts in southern South America. Unlike its sedentary sub-Antarctic cousin, Greater Sheathbills breed farther south in summer, on the Antarctic Peninsula and adjacent islands, then migrate north to spend the winter in Patagonia and the Falkland Islands. It is during these movements that some birds land on ships where, thanks to their catholic diet and confiding nature, they are readily adopted by ships’ crews. A few Greater Sheathbills reached the Cape each autumn through the 1990s, but there have been few records since 2000, following a reduction in the number of fishing vessels passing the Cape at the right time of year.

Unlike the New World cuckoos, females of all Old World cuckoos lay their eggs in the nests of other bird species for rearing. However, it can take different forms, and the Great Spotted Cuckoo has perfected its own particular, workable model which is as bizarre as any. Like most cuckoos, this species arrives in southern Africa in spring. However, not all individuals come here to breed – there are two distinct subspecies, one of which is a non-breeding visitor from its breeding grounds in northern Africa. Apart from this behavioural difference, the two are physically indistinguishable in the field. Those which do breed here seek out the active nests of crows and starlings in which to lay their eggs, showing a preference for those of Pied Crows, followed by Cape Crows and Pied Starlings. Both crows are much larger than the cuckoo, and this is why the Great Spotted Cuckoo differs from most other members of its family in this region by having its chick raised together with those of its host; Levaillant’s Cuckoo is the only other southern African species in which this arrangement occurs regularly.",

Despite these early identification difficulties, I got to know this bird quite well, because I spent a lot of time in its favoured habitat. It is one of the most common species in the undergrowth of moist coastal forests and in the dense thickets in drier habitats. It gleans leaves of low vegetation and also forages on the ground, peeking under fallen leaves and twigs, rather than tossing them aside as a thrush does. It also associates with small forest antelopes such as Blue Duikers, using them as beaters, and snapping up small insects disturbed by the animal’s passage through the undergrowth.",

Because they are quite noisy birds one often hears them long before you see them. The most characteristic call is a series of metallic clicks which accelerate and then switch to a loud trill. This tails off in a series of clucking notes. During the breeding season in early summer, the birds have a mournful repetitive ‘kweee-eep, kweee-eep, kweee-eep...’ This call can be written ‘kou-lee, kou-lee’.

A second bird was seen at the same location in December 2009. Their occurrence off the Cape is a little surprising, as Grey-backed Storm Petrels usually remain fairly close to their breeding colonies, located on sub-Antarctic islands, and they are scarce north of the Subtropical Convergence. They are easily overlooked, as their pale grey upperparts are well camouflaged against a grey sea, and they typically ghost away from approaching vessels. However, at times they can be quite confiding, feeding behind slow-moving or stationary vessels. They are often seen in association with drifting mats of seaweed, especially the Giant Kelp Macrocystis pyrifera. Their main prey are the larvae of goose barnacles (Lepas spp.), which settle on drifting items at sea. Although introduced predators have impacted some populations, the species is not listed as threatened. &#9;",

But it is a radical difference in habitat that most sets the two apart. In southern Africa, the Grey-headed Parrot occurs in sweltering, low-lying tropical woodlands, especially along lowland rivers. It is typical of Mopane Colophospermum mopane woodland, often with gigantic Baobabs Adansonia digitata, and it also inhabits Brachystegia woodland. The closest the two come to meeting is in north-eastern South Africa, where a small outlier of Cape Parrots occurs in the cool highland forests of the escarpment perched well above the nearest populations of the Grey-headed Parrot in the hot lowland savannas below. Whether the two subspecies of the Grey-headed Parrot, suahelicus of central and southern Africa and the poorly known nominate of West Africa, are truly conspecific is another matter.

They are thought to be largely sedentary, but with some movement over unknown distances. They breed from September to December, with six of the eight nests ever found having been in October.

In sharp contrast, the expatriate government officers lived in a line of white-painted, conventional brick houses, each of which boasted its own family of House Sparrows!",

In southern Africa, it was first recorded at the Swartkops estuary, Port Elizabeth, in March 1987. This bird arrived with and often accompanied a Black-tailed Godwit, suggesting that the two may have arrived together via the western Palaearctic. Subsequently there have been records of single birds at Langebaan Lagoon and Berg River estuary in February 1989, February and September 1990 and through the summer of 1990/1991, all thought to refer to the same bird. There have been three subsequent records: one at Walvis Bay in December 2000, one at Langebaan Lagoon in early 2010, and one at Voëlvlei, near Vleesbaai, Western Cape, in January 2012.",

The Yellow-billed Egret is the second-largest in the line-up, intermediate in size between the Great and the Little Egret. Its scientific name is based on this feature, and it is known as the Intermediate Egret in parts of its range. Size differences are deceptive, and unless one sees Great and Yellow-billed Egrets standing side by side, it is easy to misjudge this: both have all-white plumages, long, slender necks, dark legs and, in Great Egrets outside the breeding season, similarly-coloured bills. In these circumstances the important identification details to check are the leg colour and specifically the colour of the tibia, i.e. the upper part of the leg, above the ‘knee’ (which is actually the bird’s ankle) – this is yellow in Yellow-billed Egrets, giving it a two-tone leg, and black in Great Egrets, giving it an entirely black leg. Secondly, the Yellow-billed Egret lacks the black line running from the bill back below the eye which is conspicuous on the Great Egret. When the birds are wading in flooded grass their legs are not always visible and one then relies on the length of the bill and neck which in the Great Egret are substantially longer, proportionate to body size, than in the Yellow-billed Egret.",

The birds avoid croplands, but occasionally occur in old fallow fields being colonised by shrubs such as Renosterbos Dicerothamnus rhinocerotis. Karoo Larks are found in shrublands, including strandveld, sand-plain fynbos and dwarf Karoo shrubland, favouring those on soft, sandy soils; they are less frequent on sandy clays and generally avoid rocky areas. The birds are noticeably less common where shrubs are shorter, such as those impacted by high grazing levels, and are less common on the shrublands of the cold, high-altitude plateau of the central Karoo. The poorly drained, very stony shrublands on clays in the central Karoo have low populations of Karoo Larks. The distribution of the Karoo Lark overlaps with Barlow’s Lark in a narrow contact zone between Port Nolloth and Sende&#173;lingsdrift, and apparent hybrids between the two species have been observed in this area.

They breed in spring at sub-Antarctic islands. After breeding, they disperse south, foraging along the edge of the ice-free zone, reaching the edge of Antarctica. It is an extremely rare vagrant in southern Africa in most years, but irrupts into the region occasionally. There was a small influx in August-September 1980, and then a major irruption in July 1984, when hundreds were subsequently wrecked from the Western Cape to northern KwaZulu-Natal. This coincided with irruptions of other Southern Ocean species that typically remain well south of the continent, notably Blue Petrels. A similar wreck occurred at the same time in Australasia: indeed, in south-west Australia a disbelieving birder came across a Kerguelen Petrel flying over arid plains 200 km inland!

Its distribution is largely determined by the availability of suitable bodies of water, but although it is most closely associated with water it also occurs in dry habitats such as at airfields and dry pans. In coastal areas it favours salt marsh habitats rather than the open shore, but does forage on mudflats in estuaries at low tide.

The westering sun cast an orange glow over the field and made me wonder if the seeming orange colour of the bird’s flanks was genuine or not. Gill’s First Guide illustrates a rather dull-looking ‘Cape Thrush’ (as the Olive Thrush used to be called). It does not have a picture of the Kurrichane Thrush, and though it describes it in the text, it does not mention the diagnostic throat pattern. But a major problem was the ploughed field.

Its scientific name immutabilis refers to the lack of age-related variation in either plumage or soft-part coloration, which is unique among albatrosses. There are only two records from outside the Pacific Ocean, both in the south-west Indian Ocean: one just inside South African territorial waters off Cape Agulhas in April 1983 and one north of the Crozets in December 1984. The bulk of the population breeds in the north-west Hawaiian Islands, foraging mainly in temperate waters to the north of the islands. It is listed as Near-threatened following steady decreases in key populations since 1990, apparently linked to accidental mortality on fishing gear. The steady accumulation of plastic litter in the North Pacific has resulted in birds consuming large amounts of litter at sea, some of which they pass on to their chicks. This reduces the amount of space in the stomach for food, is a source of toxic compounds, and in extreme cases can damage or block the digestive tract, killing the chick.",

The bulk of the world’s Lesser Spotted Eagles breed in Belarus, Latvia and Poland, and they arrive there in late March, nest, and depart again in September, embarking on a tremendous journey of nine to ten thousand kilometres. Everywhere they minimize sea crossings, first using the Bosporus Straits, then skirting the Mediterranean along its eastern edge, and finally crossing into Egypt at the Suez thereby avoiding a wide Red Sea crossing. This is done in order to benefit from the rising warm air coming off land masses, and they cover about 150 km/day as they move south, gaining lift on the thermals and gliding from one to the next.

As a result, Light-mantled Albatrosses are rare vagrants to southern Africa, with almost all records of storm-driven birds that are found sick or dead ashore. Despite their very long wings, Light-mantled Albatrosses are surprisingly accomplished divers, reaching depths of up to 12 metres. Both species of sooty albatrosses feed mainly on squid, but small seabirds feature in their diets so regularly that they appear to target them as prey rather than simply scavenging dead or dying individuals. Although Light-mantled Albatrosses are occasionally caught on longlines, their populations are more stable than those of Sooty Albatrosses; probably because there is much less fishing effort in their preferred foraging areas. Numbers at South Africa’s Prince Edward Islands appear to have increased over the last few decades, and the species is currently listed as Near-threatened.",

In flight, it alternates bursts of shallow, rapid flapping with glides, the duration of which increase with the wind speed. Two races occur in the region: the silvery-backed sub-Antarctic race P. a. elegans and the smaller, white-faced Australasian P. a. tunneyi. The two can be readily separated at sea, and some authorities recommend treating them as different species. P. a. elegans is a scarce winter visitor, occurring mainly in oceanic waters south of 35ºS, although a few occur with other shearwaters over the continental shelf.  P. a. tunneyi occurs mainly off the south and east coasts, where it may occur in small numbers year-round. One came ashore at night on Bird Island, Nelson Mandela Bay, in the Eastern Cape in two successive years, and others have been found ashore on Robben Island in the Western Cape. It sometimes follows ships and occasionally scavenges behind fishing vessels. Its diving ability has not been measured, but it is likely to be extremely proficient. Its population has been impacted by introduced predators at several colonies, but it is not listed as threatened.",

Most of the population spends the non-breeding season in Africa, with the more easterly breeding birds migrating to the Indian subcontinent. In our area it is found equally commonly on freshwater and saltwater habitats, but it is only in large, sheltered, tidal embayments such as Walvis Bay that numbers may run into their thousands. At freshwater sites in our region they normally occur in small parties that come together at night to form communal roosts that may number a few hundred birds. Because they occur in small numbers scattered over the vast area of interior southern Africa it is very difficult to estimate the size of our visiting population, which is thought to lie anywhere between 60&#160;000 and 200&#160;000 birds.",

A population explosion appears to have begun soon after this and by 1936 Gill, in his guide to South African birds, could describe it as common in many parts of the country, especially in the Karoo and on the Highveld; its range and numbers have continued to increase and flocks of ‘circussing’ Little Swifts are now a familiar feature over most settlements in southern Africa.

Macaroni Penguins are less agile ashore than rockhopper penguins, typically requiring a more sheltered landing site. They breed in dense, teeming colonies, sometimes numbering hundreds of thousands of pairs. Their countless comings and goings strip away all soil and peat, leaving a barren landscape that comes alive only during the short summer breeding season. After raising their chicks they undertake a brief pre-moult fattening trip before returning to their colonies to moult their feathers during March and April.",

It occurs throughout much of southern Africa outside the arid regions, but penetrates the dry west along rivers, including the Gariep. The birds hunt from a low perch over the water, watching for fish and frogs below. While scanning downwards, the bird often bobs its head: this apparently helps it to see or perhaps aim at a prey item. When prey is spotted the bird aims with its beak pointing at the fish or frog. It then dives off the perch and grasps the prey in its beak, often returning to the same perch to eat its catch. When approached, a Malachite Kingfisher typically drops off its perch and flies low and fast across the water to another perch, usually around the first bend in the river. However, if approached by canoe or boat, they will often allow a close approach before darting off at high speed.",

The dark eye and crossbarring on the tail are reminiscent of Burchell’s Starling, but this species is appreciably smaller with a much longer, narrower and strongly graduated tail. Again, like Burchell’s Starling, juveniles have matt black underparts, lacking iridescence. There have been three records of birds with uniform pale grey plumage, one of which also had pale yellow eyes, closely resembling Tanzania’s Ashy Starling L. unicolor. However, all were in groups with normal Meves’s Starlings, and these birds merely appear to be a rare aberrant plumage variant.

In some areas, for example the Drakensberg, Magaliesberg and other sites on the interior highlands, Mocking Cliff-Chats move to lower altitudes in the winter. It has been suggested that these movements are driven by the loss of leaves from deciduous trees rather than food shortages. Their habitat is the fairly closed riverine woodland in rocky ravines and gullies, and more open woodland or scattered trees below cliffs, boulder-strewn hillsides and the large boulders along streams or rivers in valley bottoms. The birds are usually seen in pairs or family groups, often bounding or running over rocks and along branches, or disappearing into passages and tunnels among boulders, and then reappearing some distance away. Their tolerance to habitat transformation is high, and the birds become tame around human settlements, especially farmsteads where there are old stone walls or ruins of stone buildings.",

An-gola Pittas are also beautiful but restricted to a very limited area, whereas trogons can be found in most forest patches from the Cape’s Grootvadersbosch to the Zambezi. At the same time it gen- erally requires a good deal of patience and perseverance to locate a trogon and see it clearly. Unfortunately, they have a nasty habit of showing none of the red and presenting the birdman with a green back view only. The bird can be seen to be watching you with both eyes because, like an owl, trogons can easily turn the head through 180degrees but still the red chest and belly will be facing away. Eventually securing that ‘tick’ for your list always gives a sense of achievement.</p><p> Trogons occur most plentifully in the New World with 24 species occurring in their tropics, and there are another dozen species between India and the Philippines. Africa has only three species, the others being the Bar-tailed Trogon of montane for- est distribution and the Bare-cheeked Trogon which keeps to the depths of primary lowland forest. Our trogons live on large items of living prey: caterpillars, tree frogs, geckos, etc., whereas the western birds eat a lot of fruit. The neotropical birds also of- ten excavate their own nest holes, whereas our African birds use natural hollows despite their strong hooked and notched beaks. The oriental birds sport a lot more brown and yellow in their plumages but lack the iridescence and shine to their nevertheless striking colours. </p><p>Although trogons are reported to be resident in some areas there is no clear picture of their status, and many places are not occupied throughout the year. They are primarily associated with forests but occur in many lowland riverine strips. In summer they also extend into parts that support well-developed mopane trees but they are not resident in the mesic woodland on the Zimbabwe plateau. While the colours of these birds are most exciting, they are very dull in their behaviour. They sit still for long periods and you seldom see them unless they fly across the road in front of you. They are easiest to locate when they are calling, that is from September through to December. </p><p>But there is a lot of green in these forests which camouflage the bird, and so one has to look for the tail moving in order to locate the bird. The tail moves about 40 mm back and forth with each ‘whroo-whroo, whroo-wroo’ call. This goes on for twenty to thirty seconds at a time at about three double notes every five seconds. But the best way to see trogons is to visit a trogon area at sing- song time. Dr Brosset of Gabon talked of Un chanson des trogons. </p><p>This is apparently a feature of the behaviour of some trogons in each of the continents on which they occur. for a few weeks be- fore the breeding season two or three males get together in the same tree and give their ‘whroo-whroo’ calls. But they don’t stay in one place. They move through the forest gathering more recruits as they go until there are as many as six or seven birds. Some birds fall out and go back to their nesting territories but others join, and the group will cover a kilometre and more in a morning. The trick is to get to the right forest, during the right weeks, at the right time of day and to be in the right place to intercept them on their route for that day. Then there are trogons all around you for three or four minutes. </p>",

The two species differ in breeding season and habitat (see Southern Giant Petrel), but occasional hybrids have been recorded. Both species use a mix of scavenging and predation to secure food. Some adult males are predatory at Tristan da Cunha, catching and killing Northern Rockhopper Penguins at sea, grabbing them by the back of the head and holding them underwater until they drown. They have also recently been recorded killing albatross chicks at the Prince Edward Islands. Off southern Africa, Northern Giant Petrels are most abundant around fishing vessels at the shelf break, but they also come close inshore, especially at seal and seabird colonies, where they greatly outnumber Southern Giant Petrels. Although they are killed occasionally on fishing gear, and have been impacted by introduced predators at a few islands, populations at most sites are stable or increasing, probably as a result of the increase in fur-seal populations and the associated increase in the amount of carrion.",

Some gardeners object to the seeming plunder of ‘their’ earthworms by thrushes, but (as with most ‘harmful’ birds) there is a credit side to the thrushes’ foraging activities. They also eat snails (cracking their shells by beating them against an exposed woody root or stone), slugs, cutworms and a whole range of invertebrates that they find by turning over leaf litter.

It is more diurnal in its habits than other owls in the region, not given to retreating into a dark thicket during the day, or adopting the sleepy daytime look of other owls. Instead it fixes one with a penetrating stare whenever it is encountered, switching its long expressive tail from side to side if agitated, or jerkily swivelling its head as if to check for potential threats to left and right. It has the unusual ability to rotate its head through 180 degrees, so can glare at you over one shoulder, then rotate and glare at you over the other.

It has a rather slender head for the size of its body, and its ink-black, rather close-set eyes are fringed by a pale buff facial disc. A closer look at its feet reveals that the legs are unfeathered, that the claws are long, sharp and strongly curved, and that the soles of its feet are spiny, all adaptations for catching fish.

They can occur in large numbers when food becomes concentrated, but normally one finds small groups of three to ten birds. These groups may or may not be associated with the Great White Pelicans. Where they are, it is obvious that the Pink-backed Pelican is far more lightly built and the smaller of the two. Nevertheless, they are still large and fairly heavy birds which labour to take off, but once airborne they fly gracefully and may soar on thermals to considerable heights.",

Closer inspection, however, usually reveals that some of these birds are subadult males, and the group is not a harem, but simply a loose association of members of the same species. During the non-breeding season, when the adult males also revert to a female-like eclipse plumage, the Pin-tailed Whydah will form small flocks, which often join larger assemblages of other seed-eating birds, including waxbills, bishops and even larger weavers, or canaries.

Birds are sparse in the extreme south of their range and visitations are erratic. It is generally absent from the Namib Desert southwards to southern Namibia through the western Northern and Western Cape.",

When feeding they do seem to favour areas which have been trampled by game or livestock. Males are black with a red bill and white patches in the wing, while the females are dull dark brown, with a paler, orange-pink bill. Young birds are pale brown, spotted or barred on the underside. Early collectors were particularly intrigued by a rod-like structure on the belly of the two Bubalornisspecies (the White-billed Buffalo Weaver B. albirostris occurs through the Sahel belt from West Africa to Ethiopia), and suggested that this might be a copulatory organ; it is much larger in males than in females. A quote in Bannerman’s book on The Birds of West Africa stated that this body part could be used to make ‘strong man medicine’!  In fact the rod is solid, and has no tubes or channels linking it to the reproductive system, so it cannot serve to transport sperm. Another explanation offered for its function was that it served to hold sticks which were carried up to the nest!",

Its distribution range is from Angola east across the southern Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia to northern Mozambique. The habitat in most of its range is miombo woodland. In south-central Angola, Red-capped Crombecs were in climax miombo, 10 to 15-metre tall trees, and the birds foraged mostly in the canopy, searching leaves and twigs and feeding on insects. They were not common. A Red-capped Crombec nest that was found was about five metres up among seed pods in the canopy of a Kiaat tree Pterocarpus angolensis, and quite well concealed, or rather camouflaged by the seed pods. An old nest, probably from the previous year, was near the new nest. A second active nest was found in the same woodland, in a similar site, and similarly inaccessible.",

After the onset of summer rains, however, these winter visitors move back inland to the thornveld of the river valleys, where leaf flush of deciduous shrubs in bushy gullies and dongas provides sufficient cover for the birds to establish breeding territories. This pattern of dry-season movement into evergreen forest habitats that also support resident populations, and wet-season dispersal by the migrants to deciduous cover in wooded savannas, seems to occur throughout the species’ range in sub-Saharan Africa and makes its true status in any one area difficult to determine.",

They thrive in rank habitats, usually on deeper soils and at lower altitudes than Grey-winged Francolins along the Drakensberg escarpment. In the western parts of their range they inhabit open, rocky, montane grasslands, generally in wetter conditions than those preferred by Orange River Francolin. They are more sensitive to burning and grazing of grasslands than other grassland francolins. In heavily grazed and frequently burnt grasslands, they are restricted to wetland fringes and rocky outcrops. In high-quality habitat, by contrast, and particularly in protected areas, they use more of the available area and occur in larger coveys. Here, home ranges extend over 7-14 hectares and are non-overlapping.",

Rock Doves are gregarious, regularly occurring in flocks of hundreds, sometimes associating with Speckled Pigeons.

Numbers breeding in South Africa in any one year fluctuate from about 70-80 pairs to as many as 300 pairs. Breeding success is also very variable, depending on weather conditions, food resources and predation. A significant proportion of the young reared each year have been ringed but only about 7% have been proven to return into the breeding population in subsequent years. So where do the remainder go? It would appear that our birds form part of the fringe of the large Madagascan popu&#173;lation and that there may be movement between the different breeding colonies each year, with only a small proportion returning to the same breeding islands in successive breeding seasons.

Austin Roberts discovered the first nest here in 1913 and several postgraduate studies on the bird have been conducted around Wakkerstroom since then, with the result that it is now a rather well-known, if elusive, bird. On the basis of its very restricted global range it is red-listed as a Vulnerable species.",

For example the crop of one Turnstone collected on Marcus Island was full of seabird ticks, and another full of sea spiders (pycnogonids).

Sanderling numbers in the Western Cape have decreased by 90% in the last 30 years.

Few of the young of the year reach us before February or March, having loitered at sites ranging from West Africa south to Angola. Once in southern Africa this species remains extremely mobile and moves around the coast as far east as southern Mozambique. The areas of major concentration differ annually, with no real pattern being evident. Peak numbers may occur in Namibia one year, yet in other years in the Western or Eastern Cape. These movements are likely to be food related. Movement around the coastline can be rapid – a bird ringed in the Eastern Cape one January was recovered 850 km away in northern KwaZulu-Natal eighteen days later. Although spread out around the coastline, the bird favours more sheltered embayments such as Walvis Bay, Sandwich Harbour, False Bay, St Francis Bay and Nelson Mandela Bay, as well as some of the larger river mouths.",

Most authorities agree that Salvin’s and Chatham Albatrosses are ‘good’ species, but the differences between Tasmania’s nominate Shy Albatross T. c. cauta and New Zealand’s White-capped Albatross T. c. steadi are minor. We treat them as a single species – Shy Albatross – not least because they are indistinguishable in the field. Genetic evidence indicates that Tasmanian birds make up only about 5% of the birds found in southern Africa, which is roughly half the proportion that would be expected if both forms were equally likely to reach the region. Of the many chicks ringed at the three Tasmanian colonies, only birds from one colony, Mewstone Island, have been recorded in southern Africa, and all of these were recovered within a year or two of fledging; it appears that almost all adult birds off southern Africa are New Zealand birds. Indeed, colour-dyed chicks from Tasmania have been recorded off southern Africa within two months of fledging. Satellite-tracking studies, funded in part by celebrity-sponsored bird races, show that birds travel against the prevailing westerlies across the southern Indian Ocean to reach the Cape.",

These same storms also saw large numbers of Blue and Kerguelen Petrels coming ashore, and in the case of both these species we know that they had irrupted into the area some weeks before they were stranded – some as early as May – apparently as a result of some form of wide-scale disturbance in their usual range farther south. Like these species, Slender-billed Prions typically remain in sub-Antarctic and Antarctic waters. They breed at the Falklands, and at islands off Cape Horn and Kerguelen, with smaller numbers on the Crozets.

At their breeding grounds, they undertake much of their courtship in the air, giving their evocative calls and performing synchronised flights in an exquisite aerial ballet. On land they are extremely clumsy, so they breed on cliffs and ridges where they can land and take off directly at their nest sites. Both species are rare in southern African waters, with the more northerly breeding Sooty Albatross more common, occurring regularly in oceanic waters south of the continent. During severe storms they may be driven farther north, with vagrants reaching southern Mozambique. In the major seabird wreck of August 1984 one ended up on the ledge of a building in suburban Cape Town. Sooty Albatrosses breed at south temperate and sub-Antarctic islands in the South Atlantic and south Indian Oceans, overlapping with Light-mantled Albatrosses at the Prince Edwards, Crozets and Kerguelen.

Historically it was even more abundant, because it has been impacted by humans settling on many islands, and introducing predators such as rats and cats. It is much more abundant than the smaller, more coastal Bridled Tern, and is also more common in southern Africa. Large numbers are regular in the Mozambique Channel, and they occur offshore of northern KwaZulu-Natal at least in summer. They are less common inshore, usually occurring close to land only during tropical storms, when large numbers may be wrecked ashore, or even carried well inland. There have been three well-documented wrecks as far inland as Zimbabwe, and more frequent wrecks in Mozambique, Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal. Stragglers occasionally reach the south and west coasts. An interesting occurrence was of an adult that visited the Roseate Tern colony on Bird Island, Algoa Bay, throughout August 2009. This bird seemed quite at home in the colony and appeared to be fully accepted by the breeders. Post-breeding movements are not well understood and are thought to be both widely dispersive and migratory.",

The body feathering stops abruptly just below the throat and nape, ending in an odd-looking Victorian ruff that results in the head appearing smaller than it is. Adult birds have wrinkled white throats and faces, capped by a second unusual-looking feature, a waxy red-coloured cap much like a cyclist’s helmet; the bird’s name is derived from this. Because of their appearance, they are also known in farming areas where they occur by the Afrikaans name of ‘wildekalkoen’  (‘wild turkey’). The Sotho name is ‘mokhotlo’ and a village in Lesotho, Mokhotlong, is so named for their presence there.",

They also occur in the edges of evergreen forest and in miombo (Brachystegia) woodlands, where they are common and a central species in mixed bird parties. Their tolerance to habitat transformation is uncertain, but they do occur in parks, gardens and plantations of alien trees, so they obviously can cope with some changes to their habitat, or they are somewhat opportunistic, making use of whatever habitat provides their specific habitat requirements. One of their criteria for suitable habitat is the availability of cavities and hollows in trees for roosting and nest sites. Southern Black Tits roost in holes in trees and in horizontal and vertical pipes. Their behaviour pre-roosting is similar to other southern African tit species – the birds call long and loudly very near the roost site, then suddenly go quiet before dashing to the site, diving into the roost hole without checking whether it is occupied.",

They are not always easy to see because of their favoured foraging sites, but they draw attention to themselves with their loud fluting duets which enable mated birds to keep in contact when out of sight of each other. For example, when one bird calls ‘boo-boo-boo’ its mate responds ‘wheeyoo’. There are many variations of these duets, and each pair tends to have their own distinctive combinations. Sometimes one bird starts ‘hoo-whee’, repeating it at intervals before the other responds with ‘boo-boo-boo’, or vice versa. The ‘boo’ notes are similar in pitch and loudness to the call of the African Hoopoe, but the interpolation of ‘wheeyoo’ calls lets one know that it is the bush-shrike that is calling.",

In summer the birds do not seem to move far from the wetlands where they breed, and consequently are vulnerable to the destruction of these wetlands; there is some evidence for recent population declines in Botswana and southern Mozambique. During the non-breeding season they forage extensively in trees outside the wetlands, and appear to take many insects at this time of year, whereas seeds, berries and nectar are included in their summer diet. They typically form small flocks, fewer than 20 birds, and seldom associate with other weavers.

Individual males seem to be faithful to their nesting sites, and one bird was recaptured after 13 years in the same garden in which it had originally been ringed as a breeding bird. However, in Botswana there is a marked exodus of birds from the breeding areas, and there is one record of a South African bird moving more than 450 km.

However, they lack a brown juvenile plumage and never show the pink neck-staining characteristic of adults in the Wandering Albatross complex. Like the Wandering Albatross, the Royal Albatross was recently split into two species, Northern and Southern, differing in plumage maturation patterns. Both species were considered rare vagrants to southern Africa prior to 2000, with only one record of Southern Royal Albatross. This has changed dramatically in the last decade or so, with Southern Royal Albatrosses becoming more common than Northern Royal Albatrosses, and both are now seen over the continental shelf more often than Wandering Albatrosses. Traditionally both species dispersed across the Pacific between their breeding grounds at islands off New Zealand and their wintering areas around southern South America. The increasing abundance of Southern Royal Albatrosses observed off southern Africa and farther south in the African sector of the Southern Ocean suggests that more birds are either continuing downwind from South America to New Zealand, or are dispersing west from New Zealand to Africa. Most Southern Royal Albatrosses breed on Campbell Island, with a much smaller population on the Auckland Islands. They are listed as Vulnerable due to accidental mortality on fishing gear as well as habitat deterioration on Campbell Island linked to the spread of an invasive shrubby plant.",

To avoid the bitter Antarctic winter, it migrates north, with many birds moving across the Equator, especially into the North Pacific Ocean. It occurs in pale, dark and a range of intermediate colour morphs. The pale morphs are readily separated from the slightly larger, bulkier Subantarctic Skua, but the dark morphs are extremely tricky to identify. To make matters worse, they hybridise with Subantarctic Skuas where the two species’ ranges overlap in the Antarctic Peninsula, and ringed hybrid offspring have been seen off the Cape, where they were assumed to be the commoner Subantarctic Skua. If seen well, South Polar Skuas can be recognised by their blackish underwing coverts and slimmer build. They can even resemble a Pomarine Jaeger rather than a large skua. One way they may stand out is by their aggressive behaviour at sea. They have even been observed tackling Wandering Albatrosses, latching onto their tails, to the bemusement of the much larger albatrosses.",

Most birds disperse west from their only breeding grounds at Inaccessible Island towards the east coast of South America, but reasonable numbers move east, with some reaching the shelf break along the west coast of South Africa and Namibia. The challenge for birders is to pick them out from the much larger numbers of White-chinned Petrels, especially in the trawling grounds off the Cape. They tend to be more common in summer than in winter, at least off the Cape. It only breeds on Inaccessible Island in the Tristan da Cunha group, central South Atlantic Ocean, where it almost went extinct thanks to predation by pigs put ashore by sealers.

But it is in its social structure that it is particularly exceptional. This engaging lark lives throughout the year in small family parties, typically of three to six birds but up to ten, which are apparently sedentary and group territorial. Males are markedly larger than females, especially in bill length, and this may be linked to their dietary and perhaps social habits, possibly allowing the sexes to at least partially avoid competition while foraging. The species is largely insectivorous, and Ernest Willoughby found that in the Namib Desert males take a higher proportion of hard-bodied beetles, and females a higher proportion of soft-bodied ants and termites.

At the same time, birds breeding in KwaZulu-Natal undertake a migration to lower altitudes, also converging on the coastal forests. The longer-distance migration between the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal takes place at night, and some of the birds come to grief when they collide with high-rise buildings in Durban, which lie across their flight path. On nights with low cloud, some birds seemingly become disoriented by the glow of the city lights (the ‘lighthouse’ effect) and come to ground without injury, some spending the next day in well-bushed, suburban gardens.

It can be found in almost any well-developed woodland but does not occur in very open dry woodland or in forests. It is a common resident of the Miombo woodlands of central Africa and is also found in acacia and Mopane woodlands. They are fairly common in well-developed woodlands which have plenty of food, but pairs may be found in isolated patches of woodland some kilometres from the next pair. It is interesting that they are able to remain in the northern Kalahari woodlands even during the dry months of winter when one might expect food to be in short supply. It is unusual that they call throughout the year, which suggests they are resident and territorial year-round.",

For many years leading ornithologists in Europe were most sceptical about records of the age to which our passerines lived. But over the years the local ringing fraternity – those who net birds, put a numbered ring or band on a leg and then release the bird – have built up extensive records of their captures and recaptures. One of the leaders in this field was the late Mrs Dale Hanmer who worked on a few selected sites for some 35 years, during which she must have banded over 50 000 birds. She began in Malawi where her husband ran a big sugar estate and finished with some 20 plus years in the vicinity of Mutare on Zimbabwe’s eastern border. One of the Stripe-cheeked Bulbuls that she ringed early on in Zimbabwe was subsequently caught again on various occasions in the same vicinity where it was first caught and it was last recaptured 19 years and 5 months after the first capture. An Olive Sunbird she handled survived for another 18 years, although it lived quite close to where an African Goshawk nested, and a Yellow-streaked Greenbul passed 17 years. These are all records of birds that have lived in the wild. These may be unusual extremes but the Hanmer records show that our insectivorous birds live much longer than their European counterparts. General life expectancy was nevertheless much less, being just over three years as opposed to 1.4 years in Europe.",

The species’ range in South Africa has expanded westwards in recent decades: the birds were not known west of Knysna in the mid-1960s, but since then have been recorded as far west as the Cape Peninsula. It has been suggested that this expansion in range is linked to the spread of one of their food plants – the alien Castor Oil Bush Ricinus communis – but it may be due to other land-use changes, such as the invasion of previously treeless water courses by alien trees. In the Little Karoo, Tambourine Doves occur in the forested strips along the rivers in Seven Weeks Pass near Ladismith and Meiringspoort Pass near De Rust.

There is then a broad break in distribution, where they avoid the forested regions, until Ethiopia and south-eastern Sudan, and then occur fairly continuously southwards to southern Africa, part of the Congo and Angola. Birds in this latter-described range are said to form three populations (races), all of which are recorded in our region. However, as there is much variation in the plumages of birds and owing to their highly nomadic and locally migratory behaviour, the different populations tend to admix. This complicates the issue and it is more likely that there is only clinal variation with the palest birds breeding in the more arid areas and the darkest birds in the moister regions.

Studies in Zambia suggest that many juvenile birds disperse from their natal area, and that about 20% of breeding males move from one season to another. Regional differences in song suggested that Village Indigobird populations might be separated on song characteristics, but these dialects do not seem to prevent interbreeding between individuals from different regions. Rather, male birds dispersing to a new area adjust their song characteristics to match those of the new neighbours. Some ringed males have survived at least six years. During the non-breeding season they form flocks with conspecifics, other Vidua species and waxbills; even while in breeding plumage, males may feed on the ground alongside their usual host species, the Red-billed Firefinch. There appears to be little enmity between host and parasite in such associations.",

Even in southern Africa there is marked geographic variation, with males north of the Limpopo River having wholly black heads, whereas southern populations have a yellow crown.

Like most colonial weavers, males change from dull non-breeding dress to colourful nuptial plumage.

Fortunately this does not seem to constitute a threat to its populations in our region.

The birds usually arrive at the water in pairs, except in late summer when they may be accompanied by juveniles. At these drinking sites they join up with other pairs and different waxbill species, particularly Blue and Black-cheeked Waxbills. Foraging usually in pairs or small groups, Violet-eared Waxbills also join up with other species, particularly Blue Waxbills. In addition to grass seeds and various insects, they also take nectar and small fruits. This bird often seems to be associated with acacia veld, even on the Zimbabwe plateau where broad-leaved trees are the norm. This may be related to the grasses growing among the acacia trees, rather than any dependence on the trees themselves. Ringing studies show that a high proportion of the birds are recaptured at the same site over an extended period, while the oldest bird on record was more than eight years old.",

It left the nesting area in March and headed north across Angola, flying 3 500 km to its first destination in northern Cameroons.

One bird has repeatedly come ashore and called at night in an old guano shed on Bird Island, Nelson Mandela Bay, in the Eastern Cape.

The doubling of weight prior to departure on the south coast, over the adult summer norm, indicates that they are long-hop migrants probably covering the length of Africa in a single flight.

This seems to happen throughout its range, often in keeping with the availability of flowering peaks of favoured nectar-rich plants. For example, it would appear from observations in the Makgadikgadi area of Botswana that this species is migratory into the Kalahari in the wet season. Once the rains start and flowering plants blossom, White-bellied Sunbirds appear and can become very common in wetter years. Once the rains stop and flowers become less conspicuous in late March and April, they disappear – presumably withdrawing to wetter areas to the east.",

It has a powerful, buoyant flight and a characteristic underwing pattern with black tips to the flight feathers forming a continuous dark trailing edge that contrasts with the pale central part of the wing. Rarely plunges for food, normally feeding by surface dipping. To date there are only three accepted records from southern Africa, all from KwaZulu-Natal.

Essentially sedentary, White-crowned Lapwings move very short distances during times of flooding, and usually only away from the river to nearby patches of bare ground or woodland pans. Some birds do wander in small parties along the river, but these are mostly subadults moving until old enough to fill a breeding vacancy. An indication of this sort of movement is provided by one of a group of birds colour-ringed on Lake Kariba and seen 30 km east a couple of months later. These birds do not breed before two to three years of age, possibly older when breeding opportunities are scarce.

It is one of two night herons found in southern Africa and, despite similarities between the two in build, diet, nocturnal habits and sexual monomorphism, the two species don’t have much else in common. One is near-cosmopolitan in its range and occurs on a wide cross-section of wetland types; the other, the White-backed Night Heron, is endemic to sub-Saharan Africa and is largely restricted to well-wooded, slow-flowing rivers. Published maps show its distribution as consisting of scattered unconnected dots, most of these spread across the more northern savanna areas, with a few extending south and west along the eastern coastline into the Eastern Cape. Its stronghold in the region probably lies in the panhandle region of the Okavango Delta and it is certainly here where the bird is most easily seen, usually from after-dark boat rides up and down the Okavango River.",

The two species pose an identification challenge that we are just starting to understand. In the Agulhas Retroflection south and east of South Africa, extremely pale-backed birds come from the Australasian population (or perhaps Amsterdam and St Paul Islands), but birds seen off the west coast probably come from Tristan da Cunha or Gough Island, where both White-bellied Storm Petrels and a white-bellied form of the Black-bellied Storm Petrel breed. These two species can only be told apart with an extremely good view. Key features include the length of the legs (shorter in White-bellied Storm Petrel, with toes rarely extending far beyond the tail tip), width of the white rump (narrower in most White-bellied Storm Petrels) and extent of black on the underparts (less in White-bellied Storm Petrels). Whether one or both of these populations from Tristan and Gough reaches southern African waters remains to be resolved. Both species have become rare on Gough Island, presumably due to predation by introduced House Mice, but are not globally threatened.",

From studies conducted in Kenya, it is known that the basic social unit – or family – consists of a pair, with between one and five ‘helpers’ which are usually (but not always) members of the previous season’s brood. Each family forms close ties with several other breeding units from the same colony and together they comprise a clan.

It is very rare over the continental shelf in southern Africa, but occurs at low densities year-round in oceanic waters south and east of the continent. It often rests on the water, and is moderately attracted to ships, often circling a few times before moving on. Like most gadfly petrels, squid predominate in its diet.

Such behaviour seems rooted in the enjoyment of flight and has little to do with the usual daily activities of searching for roadkills (these ravens are often the first scavengers to arrive at a road carcass) or harassing any eagle or other bird of prey that they come across.",

The nests of swallows, building half-cup nests, are also occasionally used, with the mud walls of these built up to the ceiling with materials collected in flight, mostly feathers and plant detritus, glued together with saliva. While they may also nest in suitable cavities under the eaves of houses, it is for their habit of using striped swallow nests on houses that they are better known, and frequently disliked.",

They can however be flashed or turned on in times of agitation or concern, as when one peers into a nest at close range or when the bird is about to tackle a creature that might fight back.

Like many large migrant birds, the White Stork is a daytime flyer, using thermals to gain height, and gliding at speeds of up to 28 km/h until it reaches the next uplift. European populations take one of two routes into Africa: storks breeding west of a line between Switzerland and the eastern Netherlands head southwest to cross the Mediterranean at Gibraltar, the others (which include most of those that come to southern Africa) fly south-east through Turkey and the Middle East. Experimental exchanges of eggs or chicks between western and eastern European nests have shown that the young birds are instinctively programmed with the appropriate heading for their region.",

Small flocks still visit the little garden of our Bvumba shack, but they come and go. There was a time when they were abundant; that was a few years after a very hot fire had devastated the bush-encroached grassland between forest patches and a head-high regrowth of straggling Dodonea shrubs dominated for a few years. The tops of these plants held many waxbills’ nests, but that phase passed as a canopy of more robust growth became established topping out at about three meters, and most of the waxbills have gone.",

At some localities Yellow-crowned Bishops are present throughout the year, and breed predictably at the same sites, yet elsewhere they appear to arrive to take advantage of temporarily favourable conditions, and then disappear again. Thus on a farm north of Bloemfontein, Yellow-crowned Bishops nested in grasses in a shallow flooded pan in one year; the owners had not seen this species on the farm before. The following year the pan was dry and the birds were absent, but two years later when it was flooded once more, the bishops returned and nested. In the non-breeding season, Yellow-crowned Bishops join large mixed flocks of other seedeaters, and are then difficult to separate from other small bishops; the broad yellow eyebrow and whitish belly with narrow streaks are the best clues. Males probably only moult into breeding plumage in their second year, as in other bishops. There is little information on the survival or movements of individual wild birds; in captivity birds have survived up to 15 years.",

Like the other tinkerbirds, it has a loud pinging call but whereas the others call continuously, this species has an interrupted call. The bird may call three or four times and then break, and then repeat the call five or six times and then break, and so on, so that the call is quite different to any of the other tinkerbirds. The call is obviously designed to advertise the presence of the male in his territory, and during the breeding season the birds call almost continuously. At this time the bird is so busy calling and looking out for competitors that it may be approached quite closely and observed while it is calling.",

Unlike the Willow Warbler, which is a woodland bird, the Yellow-throated Woodland Warbler and its kindred African species are forest birds, mainly found in high altitude (up to 2&#160;500 m in Kenya) and mid-altitude forests; the actual altitude at which this type of forest occurs decreases with increasing latitude, so that in the southern Cape the Afromontane forest’s floral and faunal communities are found at sea level. And so is the Yellow-throated Woodland Warbler. It is also found at or near sea level in the remaining forest patches in coastal KwaZulu-Natal, but only in winter (May to August), when small numbers migrate down towards the coast from higher-elevation forests inland.",

It is also presumed that Yellow Weavers are polygynous, but this has not been confirmed. In breeding plumage the male is bright yellow, and lacks any patterning around the face; the red eye is a conspicuous field character. The female is also yellower below and smaller than most of the other species in the same habitat. After the breeding season, Yellow Weavers disperse from their nesting areas and form large mixed flocks with other weavers. However, the few records of ringed birds do not suggest that they disperse over long distances. Along river valleys they may move more than 50 km inland, whereas they are usually considered to be limited to the coastal belt, and in the Eastern Cape they may be extending their breeding range inland. Ringed birds more than eight years old were recorded in Malawi.",

Males were seen defending song posts like other indigobirds, and the plumage differences seemed quite trivial. It was only many years later that ornithologists in the field noticed that these distinctively-plumaged indigobirds were singing the twinspot song, not firefinch song. Only one case has been reported of a bird with this plumage type singing the song of the African Firefinch. So a new host-parasite relationship was revealed, as the Zambezi Indigobird evidently parasitises the Red-throated Twinspot in Zambia, Malawi and Zimbabwe and possibly the Pink-throated Twinspot in Zululand and southern Mozambique. There is little information on this bird in the field, but in captivity young were reared by Red-throated Twinspots, and the mouth markings matched those of the host. The young birds then imitated the calls and songs of their foster parent.",
